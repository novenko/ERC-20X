            Few global movements springs from individuals. We united a collective team behind something big.
             Continued work thourgh the years in the crypto space. Software Development, Crypto Mining, Smart Contracts.
              We are the middle children of history. Born too late to explore earth, born too early to explore space, 
              but what we share is a wild imagination that has always elevated us up to the task + born just in time to browse
              dank memes. Together, we work hard, we laugh a lot, we brainstorm nonstop. We are the early adaptors, 
              admiring everyone who is making a positive contribution to the community and the rest of humanity. 
              Met amazing people along the way and here we are with discussions, plans and actions of expansion, 
              metaverse estates and decetralization automnomy. 
              We're looking for Developers, Architects, Designers and Community members to bring creativity to life.
